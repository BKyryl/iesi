# Our Framework

Intelligent ETL Solution Industrialization or *IESI* is an automation framework created at Accenture to automate end-to-end delivery and 
testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). It allows the configuration, execution and 
reporting on automated executions driving development, testing and deployment automation.

> Test automation (and data-driven automation in general) should not be considered a commodity but will provide many ways of differentiation in the future

Our framework aims to differientiate itself by making automation services accessible and affordable for any project or organization.

|Fast install|Zero-touch on-premise (Cloud containers coming soon)|
|Broad access|Get ROI for small and large projects or organizations|
|Easy to use|Reusable configuration making automation faster|
|Agnostic|Technology, vendor and industry agnostic|

> It becomes easier to automate than to do it manually

Learn more on our [introduction](/{{site.repository}}/pages/introduction.html) page.

IESI was designed primarily with configuration and reuse in mind. 
It has been used at several projects and clients over the past years and evolves along with these initiatives. 
Please consider that the open source release is underway and efforts are undertaken to improve features and documentation. 
In the meantime, feel free to download and experiment with the automation framework and get acquainted with our approach. 
[We welcome contributors](/{{site.repository}}/pages/contribute/contribute.html) from any organization or background to help us grow the framework.

> We grow our framework in steps, adding new functionality when it is needed
